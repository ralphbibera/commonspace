# Commonspace design

Commonspace is a desktop workspace for conversations with local agents. Its design should help people find the right conversation, understand the available context, and follow work without losing their place.

This document defines the visual requirements. [UI direction](ui-direction.md) explains how they apply to product surfaces, [Design system](design-system.md) describes their implementation, and [Visual verification](visual-verification.md) explains how to review the result. The [Product specification](product-spec.md) defines behavior.

## Layout

The desktop shell has a stable navigation rail and a flexible working area. Use these dimensions when changing its composition:

| Element | Dimension | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Title bar | 52px high | Keep workspace identity and global controls in one predictable place. |
| Navigation rail | 260px wide | Keep destinations and their state easy to scan. |
| Working area | Flexible width | Give conversations and Project content the remaining space. |
| Pane header | 64px high | Align the title, context, and actions across panes. |
| Pane divider | 8px wide | Separate adjacent panes and provide a usable resize area where resizing is supported. |

Use visible borders, compact rows, and consistent alignment to establish hierarchy. Projects, Channels, Agents, Inbox, Threads, conversations, and Project workbenches are working surfaces within this shell.

Desktop is the current product target. Do not add mobile layouts or mobile acceptance requirements as part of a desktop design change.

## Navigation and orientation

With no saved destination, Commonspace opens to Inbox. Workspace branding is an identity mark and does not navigate. There is no separate Workspace landing page or Agent-runs dashboard.

Each surface should answer three questions: where am I, what is selected, and what can I do next? Keep titles and selection visible. Preserve the user's conversation position when opening a Thread, attachment, context panel, or Project file.

Runtime outcomes belong to Inbox and the conversation or Thread that produced them. Avoid a second surface that repeats the same outcomes without helping the user act.

## Color and appearance

The active palette lives in [`ui/src/index.css`](../ui/src/index.css). Components use semantic tokens: names such as `background`, `foreground`, `border`, and `muted` describe a color's purpose. This allows the palette to change without rewriting components.

Use neutral surfaces for ordinary content and selection. Reserve stronger color for identity, links, keyboard focus, and meaningful status. An error must also have readable text or an icon; color alone cannot explain it.

Commonspace starts in Light mode when no preference exists. Users can choose Light, Dark, or System. System follows the operating system, and the choice persists locally. Check every changed surface in both Light and Dark modes.

## Typography and spacing

Use the owned display, body, and code font roles in `ui/src/index.css`. The current body baseline is 15px with a line height of approximately 1.47. Titles, message text, metadata, and code should remain distinct through hierarchy and spacing.

Use the existing spacing scale and shared components. Keep navigation compact enough to scan and conversation text open enough to read. Align related labels, timestamps, icons, and controls. Let content length determine whether a row needs more room; do not clip important text to preserve a decorative shape.

## Shapes and elevation

Choose corner radii by component role:

| Utility | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `rounded-sm` | Compact controls, navigation rows, and small inline status surfaces |
| `rounded-md` | Fields, cards, panels, dialogs, menus, message highlights, and composers |
| `rounded-full` | Circular avatars, status dots, and pill badges |
| `rounded-none` | Full-width strips, line tabs, and table-like separators |

Larger radii need a component-specific reason. Use borders and surface contrast for ordinary separation. Reserve elevation for overlays that need to stand above their surroundings.

## Conversations and message focus

Ordinary messages remain visually flat. Authorship, text rhythm, and timestamps should explain the conversation without enclosing every message in a card.

A selected or deep-linked message keeps a quiet highlight card using a neutral surface, border, or ring. Do not use an orange rail, orange border, or orange tint for this treatment. When opening a reply, focus that exact reply in the Thread pane while keeping its Channel root as the navigation anchor.

Agent activity begins collapsed beneath its reply. When expanded, it presents the reasoning summaries, plans, tool calls, and usage that the harness actually emitted. The composer keeps the current context visible and makes slash commands and references discoverable.

Show pending routing and routing failures where they affect the conversation. Resolved assignment cards, routing reasons, timing, and inline reroute controls are not part of the current conversation layout.

## Controls and states

Controls must look interactive before they are clicked. Related filters should read as one group, with a clear selected state. Menus and suggestions should stay near their trigger, remain within the viewport, and close predictably.

Design the empty, loading, error, and dense states alongside the normal state. Explain what happened and provide an appropriate next action. Do not show implementation details such as CSS names, internal identifiers, or token terminology in product copy.

Every icon-only control needs an accessible name. Keyboard focus must remain visible, selection must have semantic state, and motion must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Acceptance

Review changed surfaces in a real desktop browser. Check the resting state and the relevant hover, focus, open, selected, empty, dense, and error states. Confirm that the action works, the layout remains usable, and the rendered result meets this document.

Use Storybook for isolated states and `pnpm verify:live` for integrated production behavior. A passing test or a saved screenshot does not establish visual quality; someone must inspect the pixels. Follow the [visual verification loop](visual-verification.md) and record any remaining gaps.
