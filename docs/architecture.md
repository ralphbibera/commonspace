# Architecture

Commonspace is a local service with a browser UI. The server owns durable conversation state and connects to supported agent harnesses; the browser presents that state through shared API contracts. This guide explains where behavior belongs and which boundaries a change must preserve.

Read the [Product model](product.md) for the domain and [Development](development.md) for setup and verification.

## Shape

The pnpm workspace has three packages:

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/shared` | Domain contracts and pure helpers used by both server and UI |
| `server` | Express API, persistence, routing, context, and local agent execution |
| `ui` | Vite/React browser application |

The product consists of Projects, Channels, Direct Messages, Agents, messages, Threads, and their shared context. Keep feature logic near its owner and use `packages/shared` as the single source for cross-process types.

Two protocols connect agent work to the workspace. Agent Client Protocol (ACP) carries native session requests, responses, activity, and permission choices over local child-process input/output. Model Context Protocol (MCP) exposes scoped Commonspace context and progress tools over authenticated loopback HTTP.

## Where changes belong

| Change | Primary owner | Update together |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cross-process type, API shape, or pure helper | `packages/shared` | Server, UI, tests, and documentation |
| State transition, migration, persistence, or routing | `server/src/state.ts` or `server/src/service.ts` | Shared contracts, regression tests, and operations docs |
| HTTP validation or response status | `server/src/app.ts` | Shared request types and API tests |
| ACP process or native-session lifecycle | `server/src/acp-runtime.ts` and `server/src/service.ts` | Harness tests and security documentation |
| Scoped MCP behavior | `server/src/commonspace-mcp.ts` | Shared contracts, ACP tests, and context documentation |
| Browser state or API coordination | `ui/src/commonspace-store.ts` | Shared contracts and client tests |
| Desktop UI and interaction | `ui/src` and `ui/src/stories` | Storybook states, accessibility checks, and integrated browser flows |

A coordinator can call another feature's capability, but should not duplicate its rules or state.

## Request path

A typical Channel send follows this sequence:

1. The UI sends a request to `/api/send`.
2. The server validates the request and persists the accepted message and any new Thread.
3. For an unaddressed message, inference selects agents and bounded sub-requests. Explicit `@agent` mentions remain authoritative.
4. The server sends each assignment to its native session. Different sessions may run concurrently; work for the same session is serialized.
5. ACP updates provide activity, permissions, and replies. Durable outcomes are persisted, and revision events tell the browser to refresh.

A routing or execution failure after acceptance leaves the source message in history. The browser displays the resulting attention state instead of losing the user's request.

In development and preview, Vite forwards `/api` to `127.0.0.1:3100`. Production browser assets are built into `ui/dist`. The archive launcher and installed macOS service give this directory to Express so that the UI and API share one loopback origin.

### Browser routes

The URL is authoritative on direct loads and browser back/forward navigation:

| Route | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Inbox |
| `/inbox/sessions` | Inbox session view |
| `/threads` | Threads |
| `/projects`, `/channels`, `/agents` | Directories |
| `/projects/:id` | Project, with encoded file detail when selected |
| `/channels/:id` | Channel, with Thread and message detail when selected |
| `/agents/:id` | Direct Message with the Agent |

Unknown or stale detail routes return to Inbox instead of restoring unrelated saved state. Each route transition clears transient Settings state. Express serves the application entry point for non-API deep links. Legacy notification query links are accepted once and replaced with their canonical conversation route.

### API groups

The HTTP boundary is implemented in [`server/src/app.ts`](../server/src/app.ts). The following groups locate the main capabilities; request and response shapes live in `packages/shared`.

| Capability | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Health and state | `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/bootstrap`, `GET /api/diagnostics`, `GET /api/events` |
| Conversation | `POST /api/send`, `POST /api/mutate`, `POST /api/stop`, `POST /api/reroute` |
| Message history | `POST /api/messages/:messageId/edit`, `POST /api/messages/:messageId/delete` |
| Context | `GET` and `PUT /api/channels/:channelId/context`, `GET` and `PUT /api/threads/:threadId/context`; `POST` to either path with `/compact` |
| Routing configuration | `GET` and `PUT /api/routing` |
| Pins and permissions | `POST /api/pins`, `POST /api/pins/:pinId/remove`, `POST /api/permissions/:permissionId/respond` |
| Projects | `GET /api/projects/:projectId/files`, `/file`, `/changes`, `/diff` |
| Attachments | `GET /api/attachments/:attachmentId`, `GET /api/files/:fileId` |
| Workspace data | `GET /api/export`, `POST /api/import`, `POST /api/retention/preview`, `POST /api/retention/apply` |
| Local discovery | `POST /api/discover-agents`, `POST /api/select-directory` |
| Agent context tools | `POST /api/mcp`, restricted to bearer-scoped ACP clients |

Server-sent events carry durable state revisions and separate temporary activity updates. The browser rejects older revisions so a slower response cannot replace newer state.

## Server

`server/src/service.ts` coordinates the workspace's durable behavior:

- It validates and persists messages, versions, branches, deletion markers, pins, permissions, and conversation outcomes.
- It maintains Channel context, immutable starting snapshots for Threads, independently editable Thread context, and pressure-triggered or manual compaction.
- It resolves zero, one, or many Project references per message and Thread. Canonical roots stay private; browser responses use folder labels and root indexes.
- It stores native-session mappings, resumes exact sessions, and recovers sessions only when a harness explicitly reports them missing.
- It accepts work immediately, coordinates independent sessions concurrently, and serializes work targeting the same native session.
- It retains routing assignments and corrections, binds replies to those assignments, and preserves prior attempts.
- It stores bounded image and general-file attachments, rejects known credential-bearing names, and imports harness artifacts only from permitted roots.
- It exposes readiness diagnostics, inference data-flow information, notifications, portable archives, and explicit retention.

`server/src/app.ts` owns HTTP limits, loopback and same-origin guards, event framing, status codes, health checks, security headers, and optional static UI delivery. `server/src/acp-runtime.ts` owns the ACP client and subprocess lifecycle. `server/src/commonspace-mcp.ts` owns temporary capabilities and scoped tools. `server/src/index.ts` owns configuration, startup, signals, and graceful shutdown.

### Service and release lifecycle

`scripts/commonspace-service.mjs` manages the macOS service. It stages source builds or extracted runtime archives in owner-only storage, writes the LaunchAgent atomically, requires a successful health check before accepting an update, and keeps one rollback release. It invokes external commands with argument arrays.

Workspace state lives outside the release directories. Switching application versions never replaces user data, and rolling back application code does not reverse a state migration. See [Operations](operations.md#backup-and-rollback).

### Development lifecycle

`server/src/dev-supervisor.ts` watches for backend changes and requests a restart through child-process messages. The running server keeps its ACP processes and MCP endpoint alive until every accepted turn finishes. Multiple edits become one replacement at the next all-idle boundary. Explicit process signals still cancel active work and shut down.

## Shared contracts

`packages/shared` defines the state and API shapes consumed by the server and UI. Internal state may contain host-private native-session references; browser snapshots remove them. A shared contract change must update every affected consumer, validation or migration rule, test, and document in the same change.

Messages and Threads use zero-to-many Project references. A singular compatibility field remains for older consumers, but new browser state must not invent a Project fallback from it.

## Agent runtimes

Hermes runs through its installed `hermes acp` harness. Discovery reads its existing native profiles; each selected profile has a reusable workspace Agent identity and retains its own native configuration. Codex uses the bundled ACP bridge with the installed Codex CLI. Each Thread or DM generation keeps its own native session. Discovery never creates or rewrites native profiles.

A native turn receives the newly delivered message or assigned sub-request and ACP resource links for attached files. Shared room context is available through scoped MCP tools instead of being replayed inside every user message. Agent-authored mention handoffs deliver only the new handoff message.

Each active native-session scope has one long-lived ACP process. Commonspace closes it on reset, removal, shutdown, or stale-session recovery. `/new` is a hard context boundary: cancellation and generation checks prevent an old reply from entering the replacement conversation.

Resumption uses the saved opaque native-session reference through ACP `session/load`. ACP frames and responses are bounded. Activity, reasoning summaries, plans, tool calls, usage, artifact links, and permission requests come from the harness. Commonspace normalizes those updates without synthesizing missing output or permission choices. A pending permission blocks only its own session. Native turn cancellation covers reset, Channel or Agent removal, timeout, and shutdown.

## UI

`ui/src/main.tsx` mounts React and shared styles. `CommonspaceApp` composes the desktop navigation and conversation surfaces. The URL determines the startup destination: `/` opens Inbox, and unknown or stale detail routes return there. The shell has no separate Workspace landing page or Agent-runs dashboard.

`CommonspaceClientStore` owns bootstrap state, selection, sends, mutations, and revision refreshes. The browser communicates with the server only through shared contracts and `/api`.

Sidebar sort preferences belong to `ui/src/sidebar-preferences.ts` and persist in browser storage. `ui/src/channel-sorting.ts` orders Channels without changing conversation data. Pinned and unpinned Channels remain separate groups when sorting or reordering.

Project scope is inferred unless the user supplies visible `@@project` references. Composers do not have separate Project pickers for roots, Threads, branches, or reroutes. [UI direction](ui-direction.md) describes the current visual treatment.

## Persistence

The current internal state version is 27, defined by `COMMONSPACE_STATE_VERSION`. Versions 1–26 migrate during load through structural validation and sanitization.

Persisted state includes the roster, appearance, workspace model/reasoning settings, host-private native sessions, bounded activity, Inbox read/unread/saved state, notification preferences, attachments, routing decisions and memory, Project references, Channel/Thread context, pins, message versions, deletion markers, permissions, and execution state.

Migration preserves conversation history while supplying explicit defaults for older shapes. Legacy per-Channel run settings are discarded. Older routing receives deterministic assignments. Older Threads receive an empty inherited snapshot and current memory derived from their transcript, rather than an invented historical snapshot. Workspaces without pin, permission, or notification fields receive empty history and opt-in notification defaults. Loaded pending permissions become interrupted because their native requests do not survive a process restart.

### Durability and privacy

Accepted messages, branches, routing attempts, pin removal records, and permission outcomes have no implicit count limit. Bounds apply to derived context and activity, not to the canonical conversation record.

Deleting delivered content removes its body, routing wording, attachment metadata and bytes, traces, and automatic projections while retaining delivery and branch metadata. Attachment bytes and the managed projectless workspace use owner-only storage.

State writes use a `0600` temporary file followed by atomic rename. The prior valid state is kept as `state.backup.json`. If the primary is invalid and the backup is valid, startup preserves the invalid file as `state.corrupt.json` and restores the backup. Bounded traces redact host details before persistence. Browser snapshots remove MCP capabilities, source file URIs, and native-session references.

### Notifications and archives

Native alerts are derived from new durable Inbox items after persistence. Existing items become the baseline at startup and import, so historical alerts are not replayed. Notification categories are independent of Inbox read state. Delivery failure cannot fail the originating Agent result.

Notification links identify conversations, Threads, and messages by their workspace IDs. The client accepts them only when they match current state on the loopback origin.

Portable archive version 1 is independent of internal state version 27. Export contains sanitized workspace records and exact attachment bytes, replaces Project roots with counts, and omits native sessions. Import requires an empty workspace and explicit existing local roots. Retention requires an owner-triggered, revision-bound preview for one inactive conversation. See [Workspace archive format](workspace-archive-format.md).

## Routing inference

Inference classifies each unaddressed Channel message after durable acceptance. It stores one bounded sub-request and Project subset per selected harness. Only that assignment is delivered; the original human message remains the canonical record and is available through scoped context.

For a new root without `@@project` tags, inference may select from all configured Projects. The message and Thread retain the union of the selected references. Explicit valid tags constrain the available set, including replacing inherited scope on an edited branch. Explicit `@agent` addressing always remains authoritative.

A service-level correction can replace the Agent or wording of one assignment. The target Agent must already belong to the Channel, and the inferred Project subset is preserved. Commonspace retains both attempts, binds replies to their assignment IDs, and does not restart unrelated Agents. Corrections contribute to bounded per-Channel routing memory without rewriting historical decisions.

Routing stores its own start time, resolution time, and duration separately from harness execution. The conversation shows pending and failed routing, while resolved assignments, reasons, timings, and inline correction controls stay outside the current UI. A failed decision marks the accepted source failed and creates a durable retryable Inbox item; it never silently broadcasts the message.

One Commonspace inference layer handles routing, routing-memory compaction, and Channel/Thread context compaction. It supports a configured agent harness or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Harness-backed routing keeps one durable session per Channel, shared across its Threads; each request still supplies only that Thread's bounded context. There is no deterministic provider mode.

Stored API keys are never returned to the browser. Changing the endpoint origin clears its stored key. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used only for the canonical OpenAI origin; other endpoints require their own explicit key when authentication is needed.
