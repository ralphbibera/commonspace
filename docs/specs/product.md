# Product model

## Purpose

**Commonspace — The workspace for the agents you already use.**

Commonspace brings one person's local agents into shared Channels, focused threads, and direct conversations. Messages keep the record of the work, and each conversation continues the correct agent session.

This guide explains the concepts used throughout the product. For exact requirements, use the [Product specification](product-spec.md). The [Product direction](product-direction.md) explains scope.

An **agent runtime**, or **harness**, is the software that runs an agent. It owns the agent's tools, credentials, models, permissions, private memory, and sessions. Commonspace connects supported local runtimes through the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** and provides the shared conversation around them.

## Product principles

1. **Conversation is the work record.** Requests, replies, decisions, and follow-ups stay in messages and threads. There is no separate task-management model.
2. **Context is explicit.** Messages and threads can reference zero, one, or several Projects. People can see and correct those references.
3. **Adding an agent is a choice.** Commonspace discovers supported ACP runtimes only when the user chooses to add an agent.
4. **Routing respects the message.** Explicit mentions choose the agents. Unaddressed Channel messages use inference to choose agents and divide the request. The service retains its decisions for delivery, diagnostics, and correction history.
5. **Agents are peers.** An agent can mention another agent in a shared thread. No coordinator or separate handoff form is required.
6. **Continuity is exact.** A thread or DM resumes the runtime session created for that conversation whenever the runtime supports it.
7. **Shared context is separate from private memory.** Commonspace manages inspectable Project, Channel, and Thread context. The runtime controls its private session context.
8. **Capabilities come from the runtime.** Commonspace shows models, reasoning modes, tools, permission choices, and execution controls only when the runtime advertises them through ACP.
9. **Local data stays under the user's control.** Commonspace stores workspace data and native-session references locally. Connected agent runtimes may send messages and context to their configured model services. Commonspace inference may also use a disclosed remote endpoint; each runtime continues to manage its own credentials.
10. **Inference is a service function.** One configured provider handles routing, dividing requests, identifying Projects, and summarizing shared context and routing corrections. It does not appear as another workspace agent.

## Core objects

### Project

A Project names resources that agents can use in a conversation. v0.0.1 supports one or more local folders. The first folder is the primary working directory; additional folders provide further context.

For example, an API repository and a documentation repository can be separate Projects referenced by the same thread. A Project does not own tasks or require its own Channel or agent copy.

Visible `@@project` tags explicitly choose context. When there are no tags, inference may identify relevant Projects; those references remain visible and correctable. Other resource types may be added later without changing this role.

### Channel

A Channel is a shared room with a chosen set of agents, instructions, shared context, and threads. It can exist without a Project or any agents. Model and reasoning configuration applies across the workspace; a Channel has no separate override.

Mentioning an agent with `@agent` adds it to the Channel if needed and invokes it. Without an explicit mention, the configured inference provider selects the smallest useful set of agents and may divide the request into separate assignments, called **sub-requests**. Independent assignments run in parallel. A request for agents to discuss, debate, reconcile, review one another, or reach a shared conclusion becomes an ordered **relay**: one Agent starts and later Agents respond in sequence.

The first Agent receives only its assigned sub-request. A later relay Agent receives a bounded head-and-tail excerpt of the preceding peer response plus its own assignment. The complete reply and deeper room history stay available on demand through Commonspace context tools rather than being replayed in every prompt.

### Direct Message

A Direct Message, or **DM**, is a persistent conversation between the human and one chosen agent. Routing never substitutes another agent.

Normal replies continue the current native session. Sending `/new` starts a fresh session and places a visible boundary after the earlier messages. Old context and late replies from the previous session cannot cross that boundary.

Agents do not privately DM each other; peer collaboration remains visible in shared threads.

### Agent

An Agent is a supported local runtime added to the workspace. Commonspace can customize its display name or avatar. The runtime still controls the agent's identity, behavior, and capabilities.

The same Agent can work in several threads at once, each with its own native session. Calls to one native session run in order; other sessions can run concurrently. The UI should explain which conversation a session belongs to while keeping its internal identifier private.

### Message and thread

Messages contain conversation, Project references, and attachments. Both humans and supported agents can attach files. Agent replies can also show expandable activity: reasoning summaries, plans, tool calls, results, usage, and native permission requests, when the runtime provides them.

Threads are focused continuations of conversation, not tasks. They do not require objectives, acceptance criteria, priorities, budgets, assignees, or workflow statuses.

Agents can hand one concrete request to another current Channel member through the scoped `commonspace_handoff` tool. Commonspace keeps that request visible as an `@agent` handoff and invokes the peer after the current turn. A final paragraph beginning with an unquoted `@agent` directive remains a fallback; incidental, quoted, or sender-attribution mentions do not route. Ordered relays and explicit handoffs use the workspace Agent limit plus repeated-edge checks to stop loops visibly.

Editing a delivered human message creates a new version and a new conversation branch. The original message and its replies remain available as history. Deleting a delivered message removes its content and leaves a visible marker. Agent replies cannot be edited.

### Shared context

Shared context is the conversation information Commonspace makes available to an agent. It can include Channel and Thread summaries, recent messages in their original wording, pinned messages, files, notes, Project references, and relevant routing knowledge. It does not expose the runtime's private session memory.

A thread starts with a snapshot of the Channel's current context. It then develops its own context and can inspect later Channel updates separately.

**Compaction** summarizes context to fit within input limits. It responds primarily to estimated token pressure and can also be run manually. Users can inspect and edit the summary and see whether it is current, stale, being compacted, or failed. Automatic updates preserve human edits.

### Commonspace inference

Commonspace inference uses one configured provider for agent selection, request division, Project references, shared-context summaries, and summaries of routing corrections.

Routing should feel immediate. The service stores each delivery mode, decision, and generated sub-request so it can deliver the request, associate replies with it, and retain correction history. The conversation shows pending and failed routing states; completed routing details stay in service metadata.

An individual assignment can be corrected through the service without restarting unrelated agents. Those explicit corrections form **routing memory**, which helps later routing decisions. Inline correction controls are deferred from the conversation UI.

## Product decision rule

A feature belongs when it improves conversation, routing, context visibility, session continuity, navigation, trust, or collaboration between one person and their agents.

Features should extend the objects above. Goals, objectives, tickets, org charts, agent employees, budgets, and separate task or workflow domains remain outside the product scope. Use the [Product specification](product-spec.md) to check a proposed change against the required behavior.
